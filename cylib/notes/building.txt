Building using this library:
If you're starting a new project, the easiest way is to copy the CoreTest project, then adjust the paths in the .csproj file.
For moving an existing project, or debugging build problems:
	- Your .csproj file will need something like:
		  <ItemGroup>
			<ProjectReference Include="..\..\cylib\cylib\cylib.csproj" />
		  </ItemGroup>

		  <ItemGroup>
			<CyContent Include="Content\**" />
		  </ItemGroup>

		  <Target Name="ContentBuild" BeforeTargets="PreBuildEvent">
			<Exec Command="dotnet run --project $(ProjectDir)..\..\cylib\cyasset --input=@(CyContent) --output=$(OutputPath)coretest.blob --coretest" />
		  </Target>
	- The reference to the cylib project can be just the dll -- but you must also copy the cylibassets.blob into your output directory.
	- All the content you want put into the asset blob must be in the CyContent ItemGroup (When adding new items with VS, check to make sure it didn't auto-remove it)
	- The --coretest argument should be replaced with anything unique per project, so the content pipeline can keep the intermediate content items separate
	- For more details on the content pipeline, see the content notes.


Dependencies are split into library and build. Library dependencies are required at runtime on the client computer. Build dependencies are only required for development.

Library Dependencies:
.NET 5.0
	- Updated 8/31/2020
	- From https://github.com/dotnet/core
	- Using RC1
	- Requires the latest VS 2019 Preview to work with VS

SDL2 
	- Updated 8/31/2020
	- Used as the base window manager and image loader, since .NET Core doesn't have the Windows bindings that .NET Framework used to have
	- C# bindings from https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS
		- git cloned into SDL2-CS folder, using the Core.csproj
		- move used dll's into the base folder, set to copy-if-newer, so they'll be copied into bin of anything with a SDL2 dependency
	- SDL2 dlls are in the SDL2-Lib directory in the cylib folder
	- Base SDL2 dlls from https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
	- SDL2_image dlls from https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
		- requires libjpeg, libpng, zlib, sdl2_image -- all with licenses.
	- non-windows binaries not supported, need a test machine

BepuUtilities
	- Updated 8/31/2020
	- Used for Matrix for Cameras, basically? Whatevs

SharpDX
	- Updated ?
	- Used for DX11 bindings -- switching to https://github.com/orgs/terrafx/packages soon™

Build Dependencies:
SDL2
	- See Lib Dependencies
	- Only kinda-sorta needs SDL_image to write out debug images -- could do without

SharpFont
	- Updated 8/31/2020
	- using the nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpFontStandard/
	- which is a .NET Core version of https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont
	- which is C# bindings for FreeType
	- depends on old version of freetype (newer versions *do* crash, enjoy) found at https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont.Dependencies
		- DLL in the base build tool directory, set to copy-if-newer
	- SDL_ttf is *not* a replacement because its hella busted (no kerning information, or really any supporting info, just render to sdlSurface)
