A general purpose windowing/rendering/input-handling library. Base library for my other probjects.
Coretest is the example/test project.

Working towards cross-platform using SDL2/Vulkan but cross-platform graphics support is getting weird so haven't bothered. All DX11 for now.
 
See the cylib\notes folder for other documentation.
